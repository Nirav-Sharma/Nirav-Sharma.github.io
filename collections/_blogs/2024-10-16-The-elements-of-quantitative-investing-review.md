Whilst working in the garden, over the summer, it occurred to me that I really enjoyed the peace, solitude & simplicity of this activity and that I would, very much, like to do more of this in the future. So being a mathematician and physicist I meditated on the nature of turbulence & induction and came up with a winning formula. I need to learn more about quantitative finance.  So who better to turn to than my favourite gardening quanty Roman professor, who happens to be writing a new book?

Giuseppe ([Gappy](https://x.com/__paleologo)) Paleologoâ€™s [*The Elements of Quantitative Investing*](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/gappy_giuseppe-paleologo-linktree-activity-7247390480278142976-Fzjp) aims to demystify the complex world of quantitative finance, providing both an introduction to the field and an insight into the mathematics required from a practical perspective.
 
One of Gappyâ€™s strengths is his ability to explain both simple and advanced financial concepts in clear terms. For instance, in chapter 1, he starts by introducing the reader to key financial terms, like bonds, equities and futures, and the investment process. He does this very clearly the aide of diagrams so that even someone with no knowledge of the finance world would be able to grasp these concepts. Later in the book he looks at portfolio optimization where he breaks down the seemingly complex mathematics into manageable steps, making it easier to understand for readers who are not experts in the field. 
 
The bookâ€™s theoretical foundation is strong, and Gappy clearly demonstrates a thorough knowledge of the mathematical underpinnings of quantitative investing. However, the practical application of these theories feels somewhat lacking in comparison. While he explains concepts like mean-variance optimization and factor models in depth, readers are not told how these strategies have performed historically or how they might be implemented in today's markets. A stronger focus on connecting the theory to real-world portfolio management, perhaps through a dedicated chapter that follows a case study from start to finish, would have provided more clarity.
 
Whilst the book could be understood by someone with little financial background, a strong mathematical and statistical foundation such as probability theory for understanding VaR or linear algebra for understanding portfolio optimisation. Gappy enjoys getting quite technical with complex formulas, and whilst this will be thoroughly welcomed by readers with prior knowledge of quantitative methods and a technical background, readers without previous knowledge might find themselves overwhelmed by the pace and technical nature of some sections.
 
The Elements of Quantitative Investing is an amazing read that probes quantitative models and finance thoroughly. It serves as a competent introduction to the field, though it requires a technical background or to be knowledgeable about quantitative finance already. The only real downside is the lack of extensive real-world examples and practical case studies. Nonetheless, it remains a useful resource for readers looking to strengthen their theoretical understanding of quantitative finance.

If youâ€™re interested to know more about this book then I have a slight longer [breakdown](https://nirav-sharma.github.io/articles/The-elements-of-quantitative-investing/) (with some pictures) to get a feel for the content of each chapter (although some of my writing is a little repetitive).  If you'd like to learn more about Gappy then start with his [linktree](https://linktr.ee/paleologo), you won't regret it!

**Disclaimer 1**: This review is based on the 9th August draft of EQI. Subsequent drafts of the book may have even better treatments of the subject matter.  Gappy has his own breakdown [here](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/gappy_giuseppe-paleologo-linktree-activity-7210307331794837504-1KSg).

**Disclaimer 2**: I donâ€™t really know a great deal about the subject matter and could not, therefore, provide a more detailed critique of the book. I picked up this book to learn more and it certainly helped me to do that.  Read the latest [draft](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JMJIunl4oUdcAbvYkYxX_U-gSms8N5yR/view) for yourself and for sake of all that is logically consistent, statistically significant, free from endogeneity and well pruned, **(BUY THE BOOK)[https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/139426545X/]**!

No more, I promise: Gappy refers to himself as the [constant gardener](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_U6VcekmoY) but thatâ€™s only part of the story. I also like to think of him as [being there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOOghKacg40) because as we all know If the roots are strong the garden will grow. ðŸ˜Š
