#### The Elements of Quantitative Investing
<p align="center" /> 
##### Before the Trade
In Chapter 1, Paleologo (Gappy) introduces key financial tools e.g. bonds, equities and futures, and the players involved in different markets in a helpful, beginner friendly way. Gappy then explores the concept of excess returns, demonstrating how certain strategies can generate above-market returns. The chapter concludes by outlining the investment process within quantitative investing, aided by a helpful diagram (fig. 1.1).

Chapter 2 introduces the different types of returns with mathematical examples to aid explanation. Gappy then explains conditional heteroscedastic models (CHM), focusing on the GARCH model (fig. 2.2), which I found to be extremely intuitive. He also covers state-space models like EWMA and the Harvey-Shepherd model. The chapter concludes with a short but insightful section on the Kalman filter.

Gappy begins chapter 3 by explaining and providing different interpretations (fig. 3.2) of factor models to clarify different interpretations. The chapter also explores transformations of models and the applications of factor models to account for portfolio risk. Gappy then moves on to a brief and engaging description of the types of factor models.

Chapter 4 starts with the best backtesting processes and protocols, using graphs and flowcharts (fig. 4.2) to show visually backtesting protocols. The chapter ends with a detailed, well-structured look into the Rademacher anti-serum, which I found to be particularly engaging.

The fifth chapter starts with a focus on the robust loss function and its application to multivariate returns, presented in a clear, step-by-step format. Gappy then evaluates precision matrices through minimum-variance portfolios and Mahalanobis distance. The chapter concludes with ancillary tests like testing betas and the coefficient of determination. 
<p align="center" /> 
Chapter 6 covers the inputs and processes behind factor models (proc. 6.1), which gave me a much deeper understanding of factor models, followed by a detailed exploration of cross-sectional regression and loadings matrices. Gappy rigorously explains the factor covariance and idiosyncratic covariance matrices. The chapter ends with a discussion on winsorization of returns and fundamental factors.

Continuing the focus on factor models, chapter 7 introduces statistical factor models. Gappy begins with the basics and moves to more advanced topics like principal component analysis (PCA), which was particularly interesting to mathematician like myself. He compares PCA to the spiked covariance model using thorough mathematics and graphs (fig. 7.7).

##### During the Trade
The second part of the book, during the trade, begins by focusing on portfolio management. Gappy explains the basics of mean-variance optimisation and its application to different portfolios, which I found to me especially fascinating. He also discusses trading in factor and idiosyncratic spaces. The chapter ends with a look at diversification and the information coefficient performance ratio. 
<p align="center" /> 
Building on the previous chapter, Gappy explores the shortcomings of the naïve mean-variance optimisation model, using graphs to illustrate (fig. 9.3). He examines the impact of constraints on model performance and how estimation errors can affect results. Chapter 9 concludes with a discussion on how a lower Sharpe ratio doesn’t necessarily lead to lower returns that I found to be engrossing.

Chapter 10 emphasises the market impact of transactions, with Gappy explaining it using a combination of visuals (fig. 10.1), maths, and bullet points. He briefly touches on multiperiod optimisation and goes into a particularly intriguing exposition on the Baldacci-Benveniste-Ritter model, providing comparisons and examples.

</p>
Gappy shifts focus to hedging, starting with a general explanation, with exercises (ex. 11.2) to aid in understanding, before moving to time-series hedging and tradable factors. He addresses challenges in hedging portfolios and introduces factor-mimicking portfolios as a solution. Before this chapter, I had little understanding of hedging, but his explanations were clear and comprehensive.

##### After the Trade
Gappy now moves on to the final part of the book, after the trade, where he first covers the Kelly criterion using scenarios, maths, and graphs (fig. 12.3) to illustrate his points. He then explains the intuition and mathematics behind Kelly strategies, concluding with a deep dive into the fractional Kelly strategy that was notably captivating.

In the closing chapter, Gappy discusses performance attribution, examining the distinction between luck and skill in model performance. He focuses on idiosyncratic profit and PnL, providing a satisfying conclusion to the book. This concluding chapter was a fitting end to an insightful and engaging read.
